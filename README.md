# Sundaes Testing Library app

Cool Sundaes shop tested with [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) and [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/).

If you want a project for practicing your testing skills, just clone this repo, get rid of all tests files and start testing! ðŸš€

## Dev mode

- As scoops and toppings options' server, I've used [this Sundae server](https://github.com/bonnie/udemy-TESTING-LIBRARY/tree/main/sundae-server)
- Clone it locally, and run `npm start` to have available the needed endpoints:
  - `GET /scoops`
  - `GET /toppings`
  - `POST /order`

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

Don't forget to run simultaneously the server!

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
